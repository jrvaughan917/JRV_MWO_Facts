		<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/342200/">MechWarrior Online</a> is a free to play game launched in 2013 which is the next installment in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a> series of games. It involves piloting a giant, lumbering robot called a battlemech, and fighting other battlemechs in a wartime scenario. MechWarrior Online, like all MechWarrior games, is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BattleTech">BattleTech</a> table-top game which was developed in 1984, which is a game rich in lore and strategy. MechWarrior Online was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha_Games">Piranha Games Interactive</a>, a Canadian game development studio, and runs on CryEngine.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		The gameplay centers around epic 12 vs 12 battles in large, well-designed maps set in other-worldly planets. One of the best parts of the game is the ability to customize one's mechs and can experiment with different kinds of loadouts and strategies. MechWarriors can tweak the weapons, equipment, engines, jumpjets, heatsinks, armor levels, equipment, camo, and much more of their mech to their liking.
		</p>
		
		<strong>Game modes:</strong>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
			Domination: Teams must maintain control of a large target area for 1 minute. Control time is accrued when the areas is occupied by friendly mechs, and no enemy mechs are within the area.
			</li>
			<li>
			Conquest: Teams must gather 750 resource points. Mechs can take over resource production facilities from the enemy, or lose them to the enemy mechs. Over time, these resource points produce resources.
			</li>
			<li>
			Assault: Each team has a base. They must protect their base, and either take over the enemy base or destroy all enemy mechs. Control of a bases is gained by occupying the area for a time while no enemy mechs are on the base.
			</li>
			<li>
			Skirmish: Team must destroy all enemy mechs.
			</li>
			<li>
			Invasion: Attackers must penetrate the enemy base and destroy several key buildings inside the base
			</li>
			<li>
			Scouting: Attacking team must gather data points, defending team must defend the data points
			</li>
			<li>
			Escort: Attacking team must destroy a VIP mech who traverses the terrain towards an extraction point. Defending team must defend their VIP at all costs.
			</li>
			
		</ul>
		<p>
		In addition to regular player-versus-player games, MechWarrior Online also allows players to join specific factions, and battle against other factions for glory and in-game currency. If your particular faction fares well, it can take over more planets in the in-game galaxy and through that earn the faction members prestige and additional income.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Completing a game grants currency known as C-bills, which can be used to purchase new mechs, upgrade current mechs with better equipment such as weapons and engines.
		</p>
		<p>
		Completing games may also grant things such as mech currency (MC), which can be used to purchase mechs and equipment, and can also purchase mech bays and cosmetic items such as camo patterns, colors, and in-cockpit decorations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Completing games also grants experience (XP) which can be used to upgrade pilot skills which offer numerous boosts to the mech which was piloted during the match.
		</p>
		<p>
		While MWO is free to play, players can purchase C-bills and MC with cash, so that they can more quickly obtain new mechs, equipment, and cosmetic items. 
		</p>
			<h2>Mechs</h2>

		</table>
		

							
		<p>
		There are over 70 different mechs in the game, and Piranha Games Interactive continuously is adding more over time. These mechs are directly descended from the BattleTech franchise, and many of them are familiar MechWarrior mechs such as the Timber Wolf, the Mad Dog, the Nova, the Summoner, the Kit Fox, and many more. Each mech has 3-8 different mech variants, each with their own look and feel, cockpit design, hardpoint layouts and quirks which make them unique

		<h2>Equipment</h2>
		In addition to an expansive set of mechs to choose from, MechWarrior Online also provides many different ways to outfit a particular mech. There are many different kinds of weapons, which are too long to list in entirety, and also there are different types of equipment and modules that help your mech fulfill its intended role. Because of MechWarrior Online's vast customization options, no two mech is the same, and thus replayability is high as every game plays differently depending on what mech you are using and what tools you've equipped on that mech.
